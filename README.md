## 🚀 Project Overview

This simple calculator was developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** during the foundational stages of my development journey as part of a virtual internship. While basic, the project was instrumental in helping me understand UI layout, DOM manipulation, and styling principles. I've preserved this project as a symbolic marker of my growth — a reminder of where I started and how far I've come.
